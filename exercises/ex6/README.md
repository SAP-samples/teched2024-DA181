# Exercise 6 - Bind your application to an HDI Container and view the data in SAP HANA Database Explorer

In this exercise, you will create a [SAP HANA Deployment Infrastructure ( HDI ) container](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_PLATFORM/3823b0f33420468ba5f1cf7f59bd6bd9/3ef0ee9da11440e4b01708455b8497a9.html) and bind that container to our project and deploy the project to SAP HANA Cloud.

Note, as a prerequisite, you've setup a [SAP HANA Cloud Instance](https://developers.sap.com/group.hana-cloud-get-started-1-trial.html) incl. a cloud foundry environment, in case revisit the [pre-requistes check detaiks](/exercises/prerequistes/).

## Exercise 6.1  Login to your Cloud Foundry space and create a HDI container

<br>__1.__ _Login_ to __Cloud Foundry "environment"__ under your BTP subaccount and your __Cloud Foundry "space"__.  
- Click on __"CF login"-icon__ in the left-side activity bar
![alt text](/exercises/ex6/images/cf-login_icon.png)
  - or or alternative search for the CF login command in the top command search  ![alt text](/exercises/ex6/images/cf-login-cmd.png)   
- Specify the correct __"Cloud Foundry Endpoint URL"__ from your subaccount
- then select SSO Passcode and _click_ __"Open a new browser ..."__ to generate and copy a SSO passcode
- __Paste the Passcode__ and then click __"Sign in"__

<br>__2.__ Go to Project Explorer, Click on Terminal. Enter the below command to add mta and hana. You will now see the project in the left bottom pane under SAP HANA Projects.

```shell
cds add mta
```
```shell
cds add hana
```

## Exercise 6.2  Go to SAP HANA Database explorer and check the tables

<br>__12.__ Click on database exploerer icon under SAP HANA Projects, which will open the SAP HANA Database explorer view. 

<br>![](/exercises/ex7/images/dbx.png)

<br>__13.__ Generated artifacts are shown as below:

<br>![](/exercises/ex6/images/gen.png)

<br>__14.__ Sample data that was generated will not be seen in the below tables, as it will return empty.The data that was generated in step 2 is not on an production and is used for testing purpose only. In order to add the data, 

![alt text](/exercises/ex6/images/image-6.png)

<br>__15.__ create a new folder called under db folder

![alt text](/exercises/ex6/images/image-7.png)

<br>__16.__ name the folder as 'data' as shown below.

![alt text](/exercises/ex6/images/image-8.png)

<br>__17.__ copy the csv files that is shown below.

![alt text](/exercises/ex6/images/image-6.png)

<br>__18.__ paste the csv files in the newly created data folder ( db>data)

![alt text](/exercises/ex6/images/image-9.png)

<br>__19.__ Your folder structure should look as follows

![alt text](/exercises/ex6/images/image-10.png)

<br>__20.__ Data editor will also reflect the changes as follows for both risks and mitigations: sample data is used for testing purposes only, and initial data is the data used for production.

![alt text](/exercises/ex6/images/image-12.png)

<br>__21.__ Deploy the application

![alt text](/exercises/ex6/images/image-13.png)

<br>__22.__ Once deployed successfully, Navigate to SAP HANA Database explorer and review the data.

![alt text](/exercises/ex6/images/image-14.png)

<br>__23.__ Review the tables and the data that is generated by the cds definitions and annotations.

## Summary

You've now created a new HDI container and bound to your CAP Project. You can deploy the project to your SAP HANA Cloud instance and view the data in SAP HANA database explorer.
