# Exercise 6 - Bind your application to an HDI Container & View the data in SAP HANA Database Explorer

In this exercise, we will create a [SAP HANA Deployment Infrastructure ( HDI ) container](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_PLATFORM/3823b0f33420468ba5f1cf7f59bd6bd9/3ef0ee9da11440e4b01708455b8497a9.html) and bind that container to our project and deploy the project to SAP HANA Cloud.

Note, as a prerequisite, you've setup a [SAP HANA Cloud Instance](https://developers.sap.com/group.hana-cloud-get-started-1-trial.html) incl. a cloud foundry environment.

## Ex 6.1  Login to CF space and create HDI container

1. In Business Application Studio, you need to login to Cloud Foundry and add your subaccount & space.  
You can navidate to the CF login from the menue on the left

## Exercise 6.2  Go to SAP HANA Database explorer and check the tables

1. Click on database exploerer icon under SAP HANA Projects, which will open the SAP HANA Database explorer view.

## Summary

You've now created a new HDI container and bound to your CAP Project. You can deploy the project to your SAP HANA Cloud instance and view the data in SAP HANA database explorer.
