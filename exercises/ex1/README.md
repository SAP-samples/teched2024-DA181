8. Select the __dev space__ where you want the project to reside.

- SAP Build Code recommends the dev space it deems most suitable, and it will automatically create a new one for you if you don’t already have one. If you have other dev spaces of the same type (for example, Full-Stack), you can select between them. If you want to create a different dev space, or a dev space or another type, go to the Dev Space Manager. See Working in the Dev Space Manager.
