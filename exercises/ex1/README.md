Alternatively to the __Create__ (from scratch) option, once could copy existing projects to your SAP Build workspace in the following ways:
- __Clone from Git__: to clone an existing project from a Git repository.
- __Add from Dev Space__: to add a project from an existing SAP Business Application studio dev space to your SAP Build Code tenant.    

<br>__3.__ Then in the build application dialog _Select_ the __Build an Application__ tile:

<br><br>
<br><br>__8.__ Select the __dev space__ where you want the project to reside, the one you created in the previous exercise.

- SAP Build Code recommends the dev space it deems most suitable, and it will automatically create a new one for you if you donâ€™t already have one. If you have other dev spaces of the same type (for example, Full-Stack), you can select between them. If you want to create a different dev space, or a dev space or another type, go to the Dev Space Manager. See Working in the Dev Space Manager.
