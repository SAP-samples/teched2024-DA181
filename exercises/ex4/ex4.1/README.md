# Exercise 4.2 Connect your application to the Business Partner API Sandbox Enviroment

1. Import the API_BUSINESS_PARTNER from [SAP Business Accerlator Hub](https://api.sap.com/) and login with your credentials.

<br>![](/exercises/ex4/ex4.1//images/apilogin.png)

2. Navigate to the Business Partner API (SAP S/4HANA Cloud → Business Partner (A2X)).In the upper-right corner, choose Show API Key to see your API key. This is needed in the later part of the exercise

3. Download the EDMX file from the business partner and add it to the main folder.

4. Import the Business Partner file by running the below cds command in the terminal.

```cds

$ cds import API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.edmx

```
5. The API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.edmx has been imported to the folder srv/external, also it generates API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.csn file. This CSN file used by the CDS framework.

6. The package.json file is now updated in the requires section with the external service.

7. Update the schema.cds to the code given below.

```
NOTE : Keep in the mind, code can differ from the ones generated via Joule. 
```

```cds

using { API_BUSINESS_PARTNER } from '../srv/external/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER';

using
{
    cuid,
    managed
}
from '@sap/cds/common';

entity Risks : cuid, managed
{
    title : String(100)
        @mandatory;
    description : String(500);
    impact : Integer;
    criticality : Integer;
    status : String(20);
    mitigations : Association to many Mitigations on mitigations.risk = $self;
    newProperty : String(100);
    BusinessPartner : Association to one API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.A_BusinessPartner;
}

annotate Risks with @assert.unique :
{
    title : [ title ],
};

entity Mitigations : cuid, managed
{
    title : String(100)
        @mandatory;
    description : String(500);
    counter : Integer;
    effectiveness : String(20);
    risk : Association to one Risks;
}

annotate Mitigations with @assert.unique :
{
    title : [ title ],
};

```
8. In order to read the entity, create a custom handler.

```cds 

const cds = require('@sap/cds');
module.exports = cds.service.impl(async function() {
    const bp = await cds.connect.to('API_BUSINESS_PARTNER');    
    this.on('READ', 'A_BusinessPartner', async req => {        
        return bp.run(req.query);       
    });
});

```

9. Add the URL of the sandbox by making the following changes in the package.json. Copy the API key which we accessed earlier and add it in the file.

<br>![](/exercises/ex4/ex4.1//images/copyapi.png)

```json

      "API_BUSINESS_PARTNER": {
          "kind": "odata-v2",
          "model": "srv/external/BusinessPartnerA2X",
          "credentials": {
            "url": "https://sandbox.api.sap.com/s4hanacloud/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/",
             "headers": {
                "APIKey": <API_KEY>
            }
          }
        },

```
You've now created a custom handler for your service. This time it called on for the READ event.

The handler is invoked when your BusinessPartner service is called for a READ, so whenever there’s a request for business partner data, this handler is called. It ensures the request for the business partner is directed to the external business partner service. Furthermore, you have added a where clause to the request, which selects only business partners where the first and last name is set.

## Summary

You have now successfully extended the CAP service with the consumption of an external Business Partner Service
