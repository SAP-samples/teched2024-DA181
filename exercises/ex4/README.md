# Exercise 4 - Adding Business Partner Service

In this exercise, you will extend your CAP service with the consumption of an external Business Partner service from [SAP Business Accelerator Hub](https://api.sap.com/).

 ## Exercise 4.1 Connect your application to the Business Partner API Sandbox Enviroment

1. In order to import the API_BUSINESS_PARTNER from [SAP Business Accerlator Hub](https://api.sap.com/) lets begin with loging in with your credentials.

```cds

cds import API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.edmx

```
5. The API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.edmx has been imported to the folder srv/external, also it generates API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.csn file. This CSN file is used by the CDS framework.

## Connect your application to the Business Partner API Sandbox Enviroment

1. In order to read the entity, create a custom handler. go to srv > service.js. Copy the below code

```cds 

const cds = require('@sap/cds');
module.exports = cds.service.impl(async function() {
    const bp = await cds.connect.to('API_BUSINESS_PARTNER');    
    this.on('READ', 'A_BusinessPartner', async req => {        
        return bp.run(req.query);       
    });
});

```
2. Copy the API Key from SAP Business Accerlator hub.

3. Retrieve the SANDBOX_URL from the api hub.

4. Add the URL of the sandbox by making the following changes in the package.json.

```json
      "API_BUSINESS_PARTNER": {
          "kind": "odata-v2",
          "model": "srv/external/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER",
          "credentials": {
            "url": "https://sandbox.api.sap.com/s4hanacloud/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/",
             "headers": {
                "APIKey": <API_KEY>
            }
          }
        },

```
You've now created a custom handler for your service. This time it called on for the READ event.

The handler is invoked when your BusinessPartner service is called for a READ, so whenever there’s a request for business partner data, this handler is called. It ensures the request for the business partner is directed to the external business partner service. Furthermore, you have added a where clause to the request, which selects only business partners where the first and last name is set.

## Summary

You have now successfully extended the CAP service with the consumption of an external Business Partner Service
