4. Copy the below text to your joule assistant to generate the data model and services.
```
Create a risk management app with risks and mitigations. Each risk may refer to one or more mitigations. Add realistic properties to each entity, risks should include a property impact and criticality which should be an integer. Impacts should be in range of 1 to 20000 dollars. Mitigation should include a counter
```

5. You will now see the suggested data model as per the prompt given to the Joule.
